## Key Features

- Real-Time Waste Identification: Using a powerful machine learning model, Bin Buddy helps identify whether an item should be recycled, composted, or thrown away. The model is trained to recognize a wide variety of common waste materials, making it highly reliable in everyday scenarios.
- User-Friendly Interface: Built with React Native and styled using Tailwind CSS, Bin Buddy provides a smooth, intuitive, and responsive interface. Whether you're a tech enthusiast or a casual user, you'll find it easy to navigate and use.
- Cross-Platform Compatibility: Thanks to the Expo framework, Bin Buddy runs seamlessly on both iOS and Android devices, ensuring widespread accessibility.
- Machine Learning: At the core of Bin Buddy is TensorFlow, an open-source machine learning framework. The model is embedded directly into the app to provide fast and offline waste classification.

## Technology Stack

- React Native: A popular framework for building native mobile applications using JavaScript and React. React Native ensures that Bin Buddy delivers a highly performant experience across platforms.
- Expo: An open-source platform for making React Native applications that streamlines development and deployment processes. Expo allows for easy testing and deployment, as well as integration with the mobile platform's hardware features.
- TensorFlow: A leading machine learning framework used to train and deploy the waste classification model. TensorFlow's integration enables accurate and efficient real-time predictions within the app.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework used for styling. By integrating Tailwind CSS into React Native, we ensure consistent, clean, and customizable design components.
- Firebase: The backbone of Bin Buddy’s backend infrastructure, providing real-time database services via Firestore, user authentication, and scalable cloud storage. Firebase ensures the app is secure, responsive, and capable of handling high volumes of data efficiently.

## How It Works

- Take a Picture: Use the app to snap a photo of the waste item you want to dispose of.
- Real-Time Classification: The TensorFlow model processes the image and classifies the waste as recyclable, compostable, or general waste. This happens on-device, ensuring privacy and fast processing.
Guidance: Bin Buddy suggests the appropriate bin for the waste item, helping you reduce contamination in recycling and support proper disposal.
